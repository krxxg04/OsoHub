		OSOHUB is a visual social network focused on food photography. Inspired by platforms like VSCO, it offers users an experience centered exclusively on culinary aesthetics, allowing publication, exploration, and curation of images without distractions from recipes or ratings. This report presents a case study of OSOHUB as a distributed software architecture solution, developed under the 3-layer model with the data layer deployed in containers. Its business impact is analyzed, the proposed architecture is described, and the technical-economic decisions made for its implementation are documented.

	<p>
		Currently, there is no social network specialized in food aesthetics that combines the visual simplicity of VSCO with light social features. Existing platforms (Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok) are not designed exclusively for gastronomic content, which dilutes the experience for foodies, chefs, and kitchen aesthetes. OSOHUB emerges as a solution focused on that niche, providing a clean, scalable, and image-centered visual environment.

	<p>
		In addition to this market opportunity, key technical challenges are identified. One is the management of high-resolution multimedia content, which implies significant storage and bandwidth consumption. Another critical aspect is the need to maintain a fast and smooth user experience, even as the user volume grows exponentially. The platform must ensure data integrity, prevent unauthorized access, and have content moderation mechanisms to guarantee a safe and appropriate environment.
	</p>

	<p>
		From a business perspective, the challenge is to build an infrastructure flexible enough to allow future integration with new modules, such as recommendation algorithms, visual analysis tools using artificial intelligence, or integrations with gastronomic e-commerce.
